        <h1>The Best Movies According to Mathews Manuel</h1>
        <h2>My favourite top 3 movies</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>1. Platoon</h3>
        <p>The movie is based on Vietnam world war. You will love the story if you ever had a defence dream at your younger age. The visuals and the background scores gives an absolute feel.</p>
        <h3>2. The Scouts Guide to Zombies</h3>
        <p>Ofcourse, it's a zombie movie. The story tells about the survival of a group of young people (Students) from the attack of zombies. The movie has humourous scenes as well. So it's really funny as well as thrilling to watch.</p>
        <h3>3. James Bond Series</h3>
        <p>Who doesn't like to watch 007 action. It's always thrilling and fascinating to watch the JB series.</p>
